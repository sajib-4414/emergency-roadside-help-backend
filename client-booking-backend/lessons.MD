cannot query the read database during command handling for any verification,
you should only query event database like axon db.
if you need something like if client has any active bookings reject creating a booking,
then have a client aggregate, that can keep track of client's active bookings.
query that in the command handler
```java

@Aggregate
public class ClientBookingsAggregate {
    @AggregateIdentifier
    private Long clientId;
    private Set<Long> activeBookingIds = new HashSet<>();
    
    @CommandHandler
    public ClientBookingsAggregate(RegisterClientBookingCommand command) {
        // Check if client already has active bookings
        if (!activeBookingIds.isEmpty()) {
            throw new ClientHasActiveBookingsException("Client already has active bookings");
        }
        
        apply(new ClientBookingRegisteredEvent(command.getClientId(), command.getBookingId()));
    }
```
cannot use database long ids for aggregate idenfier
because there is a lag of writing to read database, i mean first it will be written to eventstoredb.
so here is eventual consistency. so with Long, database id often we cannto work, especially
for the field that is being used for aggreagate.
in this case, for booking i cannt use the long id anymore.

## Handling Errors from Command Handlers
When a command handler throws an exception, you have two options for handling it:

Option 1: Catch the Exception in the API Controller
If the command is sent directly from an API controller, you can catch the exception there and return an appropriate error response to the client.

Option 2: Catch the Exception in the Saga
If the command is sent from a Saga, you should catch the exception in the Saga and trigger compensating actions.

## Reset axon DB
goto axon dashboard->cotnext->delete context(with data).
now u will see spring boot cannot connect anymore, so create a context again.
for free tier the cotnext name is always default

## if you are getting sequence error
this happens if you use a field as aggregate id, and you keep creating commandss with 
same aggregate id. for example I have client aggregate, where client id is the target aggregate field.
so when i was requesting for booking with a single client, then axon was seeing its the same aggregate(based on id),
and some previous events, commands were having issues, not properly handled. so axon was expecting the previous sequence id, up until 
same aggregate is processed, but due to error, some events were missed, so i was getting sequence error.

One way is to just delete the context(event store), then everyting in the 3 tables used by axon
assocition_value_entry, saga_entryu, token_entry. then everything was resetted.
the sql tables contains some pointer to what was last processed sequence number or something.
if you mess up in development, u can delete those with context, and restart again everything.

But the best approach is, from axon community comments, dont design system like this, where
u will keep getting aggregates but with same aggreagate id. having a new unique aggreagate id
(like booking id, where each booking is unique) is the best usage of this aggreagate.

**More comments from claude**
The problem you described is a common issue when using a non-unique identifier as the aggregate ID. In your case, using the client ID means all operations for that client affect the same aggregate instance. This creates problems because:

- Multiple concurrent commands targeting the same client ID compete for the same aggregate
- If errors occur during event processing, the expected sequence gets disrupted
- The aggregate's event store gets polluted with unrelated events (bookings) that just happen to share the same client ID

Regarding the token: The token_entry table stores tracking tokens for event processors. These tokens track which events have been processed by each processor, 
essentially acting as offsets or bookmarks in the event stream. They help Axon know where to resume processing after a restart.

## if you are getting xstream serialization error after using command gateway
use transient and autowired command gateway. it happened in the saga class, using this solved the problem
